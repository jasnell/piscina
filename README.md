## Piscina API

### Example

In `main.js`:

```js
const Piscina = require('piscina');

const piscina = new Piscina({
  filename: path.resolve(__dirname, 'worker.js')
});

(async function() {
  const result = await piscina.runTask({ a: 4, b: 6 });
  console.log(result);  // Prints 10
})();
```

In `worker.js`:

```js
module.exports = ({ a, b }) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

The worker may also be an async function or may return a Promise:

```js
const { promisify } = require('util');
const sleep = promisify(setTimeout);

module.exports = async ({ a, b } => {
  // Fake some async activity
  await sleep(100);
  return a + b;
})
```

ESM is also supported for both Piscina and workers:

```js
import { Piscina } from 'piscina';

const piscina = new Piscina({
  // The URL must be a file:// URL
  filename: new URL('./worker.mjs', import.meta.url).href
});

(async function () {
  const result = await piscina.runTask({ a: 4, b: 6 });
  console.log(result); // Prints 10
})();
```

In `worker.mjs`:

```js
export default ({ a, b }) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

### Cancelable Tasks

Submitted tasks may be canceled using either an `AbortController` or
an `EventEmitter`:

```js
'use strict';

const Piscina = require('piscina');
const { AbortController } = require('abort-controller');
const { resolve } = require('path');

const piscina = new Piscina({
  filename: resolve(__dirname, 'worker.js')
});

(async function() {
  const abortController = new AbortController();
  try {
    const task = piscina.runTask({ a: 4, b: 6 }, abortController.signal);
    abortController.abort();
    await task;
  } catch (err) {
    console.log('The task was canceled');
  }
})();
```

To use `AbortController`, you will need to `npm i abort-controller`
(or `yarn add abort-controller`).

Alternatively, any `EventEmitter` that emits an `'abort'` event
may be used as an abort controller:

```js
'use strict';

const Piscina = require('piscina');
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const { resolve } = require('path');

const piscina = new Piscina({
  filename: resolve(__dirname, 'worker.js')
});

(async function() {
  const ee = new EventEmitter();
  try {
    const task = piscina.runTask({ a: 4, b: 6 }, ee);
    ee.emit('abort');
    await task;
  } catch (err) {
    console.log('The task was canceled');
  }
})();
```

### Backpressure

When the `maxQueue` option is set, once the `Piscina` queue is full, no
additional tasks may be submitted until the queue size falls below the
limit. The `'drain'` event may be used to receive notification when the
queue is empty and all tasks have been submitted to workers for processing.

Example: Using a Node.js stream to feed a Piscina worker pool:
```js
'use strict';

const { resolve } = require('path');
const Pool = require('../..');

const pool = new Pool({
  filename: resolve(__dirname, 'worker.js'),
  maxQueue: 'auto'
});

const stream = getStreamSomehow();
stream.setEncoding('utf8');

pool.on('drain', () => {
  if (stream.isPaused()) {
    console.log('resuming...', counter, pool.queueSize);
    stream.resume();
  }
});

stream
  .on('data', (data) => {
    pool.runTask(data);
    if (pool.queueSize === pool.options.maxQueue) {
      console.log('pausing...', counter, pool.queueSize);
      stream.pause();
    }
  })
  .on('error', console.error)
  .on('end', () => {
    console.log('done');
  });
```

### Additional Examples

Additional examples can be found in the GitHub repo at
https://github.com/jasnell/piscina/tree/master/examples

## Class: `Piscina`

Piscina works by creating a pool of Node.js Worker Threads to which
one or more tasks may be dispatched. Each worker thread executes a
single exported function defined in a separate file. Whenever a
task is dispatched to a worker, the worker invokes the exported
function and reports the return value back to Piscina when the
function completes.

This class extends [`EventEmitter`][] from Node.js.

### Constructor: `new Piscina([options])`

* The following optional configuration is supported:
  * `filename`: (`string | null`) Provides the default source for the code that
    runs the tasks on Worker threads. This should be an absolute path or an
    absolute `file://` URL to a file that exports a JavaScript `function` or
    `async function` as its default export or `module.exports`. [ES modules][]
    are supported.
  * `minThreads`: (`number`) Sets the minimum number of threads that are always
    running for this thread pool. The default is based on the number of
    available CPUs.
  * `maxThreads`: (`number`) Sets the maximum number of threads that are
    running for this thread pool. The default is based on the number of
    available CPUs.
  * `idleTimeout`: (`number`) A timeout in milliseconds that specifies how long
    a `Worker` is allowed to be idle, i.e. not handling any tasks, before it is
    shut down. By default, this is immediate.
  * `maxQueue`: (`number` | `string`) The maximum number of tasks that may be
    scheduled to run, but not yet running due to lack of available threads, at
    a given time. By default, there is no limit. The special value `'auto'`
    may be used to have Piscina calculate the maximum as the square of `maxThreads`.
    When `'auto'` is used, the calculated `maxQueue` value may be found by checking
    the [`options.maxQueue`](#property-options-readonly) property.
  * `concurrentTasksPerWorker`: (`number`) Specifies how many tasks can share
    a single Worker thread simultaneously. The default is `1`. This generally
    only makes sense to specify if there is some kind of asynchronous component
    to the task. Keep in mind that Worker threads are generally not built for
    handling I/O in parallel.
  * `useAtomics`: (`boolean`) Use the [`Atomics`][] API for faster communication
    between threads. This is on by default.
  * `resourceLimits`: (`object`) See [Node.js new Worker options][]
    * `maxOldGenerationSizeMb`: (`number`) The maximum size of each worker threads
      main heap in MB.
    * `maxYoungGenerationSizeMb`: (`number`) The maximum size of a heap space for
      recently created objects.
    * `codeRangeSizeMb`: (`number`) The size of a pre-allocated memory range used
      for generated code.
  * `env`: (`object`) If set, specifies the initial value of `process.env` inside
    the worker threads. See [Node.js new Worker options][] for details.
  * `argv`: (`any[]`) List of arguments that will be stringified and appended to
    `process.argv` in the worker. See [Node.js new Worker options][] for details.
  * `execArgv`: (`string[]`) List of Node.js CLI options passed to the worker.
    See [Node.js new Worker options][] for details.
  * `workerData`: (`any`) Any JavaScript value that can be cloned and made
    available as `require('piscina').workerData`. See [Node.js new Worker options][]
    for details. Unlike regular Node.js Worker Threads, `workerData` must not
    specify any value requiring a `transferList`. This is because the `workerData`
    will be cloned for each pooled worker.

Use caution when setting resource limits. Setting limits that are too low may
result in the `Piscina` worker threads being unusable.

### Method: `runTask(task[, transferList][, filename][, abortSignal])`

Schedules a task to be run on a Worker thread.

* `task`: Any value. This will be passed to the function that is exported from
  `filename`.
* `transferList`: An optional lists of objects that is passed to
  [`postMessage()`] when posting `task` to the Worker, which are transferred
  rather than cloned.
* `filename`: Optionally overrides the `filename` option passed to the
  constructor for this task. If no `filename` was specified to the constructor,
  this is mandatory.
* `abortSignal`: An [`AbortSignal`][] instance. If passed, this can be used to
  cancel a task. If the task is already running, the corresponding `Worker`
  thread will be stopped.
  (More generally, any `EventEmitter` or `EventTarget` that emits `'abort'`
  events can be passed here.) Abortable tasks cannot share threads regardless
  of the `concurrentTasksPerWorker` options.

This returns a `Promise` for the return value of the (async) function call
made to the function exported from `filename`. If the (async) function throws
an error, the returned `Promise` will be rejected with that error.
If the task is aborted, the returned `Promise` is rejected with an error
as well.

### Method: `destroy()`

Stops all Workers and rejects all `Promise`s for pending tasks.

This returns a `Promise` that is fulfilled once all threads have stopped.

### Event: `'error'`

An `'error'` event is emitted by instances of this class when:

- Uncaught exceptions occur inside Worker threads that do not currently handle
  tasks.
- Unexpected messages are sent from from Worker threads.

All other errors are reported by rejecting the `Promise` returned from
`runTask()`, including rejections reported by the handler function itself.

### Event: `'drain'`

A `'drain'` event is emitted whenever the `queueSize` reaches `0`.

### Property: `completed` (readonly)

The current number of completed tasks.

### Property: `options` (readonly)

A copy of the options that are currently being used by this instance. This
object has the same properties as the options object passed to the constructor.

### Property: `runTime` (readonly)

A histogram summary object summarizing the collected run times of completed
tasks. All values are expressed in milliseconds.

* `runTime.average` {`number`} The average run time of all tasks
* `runTime.mean` {`number`} The mean run time of all tasks
* `runTime.stddev` {`number`} The standard deviation of collected run times
* `runTime.min` {`number`} The fastest recorded run time
* `runTime.max` {`number`} The slowest recorded run time

All properties following the pattern `p{N}` where N is a number (e.g. `p1`, `p99`)
represent the percentile distributions of run time observations. For example,
`p99` is the 99th percentile indicating that 99% of the observed run times were
faster or equal to the given value.

## Performance Notes

Workers are generally optimized for offloading synchronous,
compute-intensive operations off the main Node.js event loop thread.
While it is possible to perform asynchronous operations and I/O
within a Worker, the performance advantages of doing so will be
minimal.

Specifically, it is worth noting that asynchronous operations
within Node.js, including I/O such as file system operations
or CPU-bound tasks such as crypto operations or compression
algorithms, are already performed in parallel by Node.js and
libuv on a per-process level. This means that there will be
little performance impact on moving such async operations into
a Piscina worker (see examples/scrypt for example).

Piscina provides the ability to configure the minimum and
maximum number of worker threads active in the pool, as well as
set limits on the number of tasks that may be queued up waiting
for a free worker. It is important to note that setting the
`maxQueue` size too high relative to the number of worker threads
can have a detrimental impact on performance and memory usage.
Setting the `maxQueue` size too small can also be problematic
as doing so could cause your worker threads to become idle and
be shutdown. Our testing has shown that a `maxQueue` size of
approximately the square of the maximum number of threads is
generally sufficient and performs well for many cases, but this
will vary depending on your workload. It will be important to
test and benchmark your worker pools to ensure you've effectively
balanced queue wait times, memory usage, and worker pool utilization.
